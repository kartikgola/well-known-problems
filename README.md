My solutions to some well-known programming problems

Best Conceivable Runtime (BCR)
    - This is the lower bound of any algorithmic problem
    - For a problem, no algorithm can do better than BCR.

Common optimizing techniques -
1. BUD
    Bottlenecks
        - Areas of code which are heavy
    Unnecessary work
        - Areas of code doing work which can be avoided
    Duplicated work
        - Areas of code calculating info. which is already there!

2. DIY
    - Use intuition and real-world examples to solve the problem intuitively.

3. Simplification & Generalization
    - Simplify the problem into a small problem

4. Base case & build
    - Start from a small example, say with n = 1 & then go all the way up until a pattern is observed
    - Example should not be a special case, be too small or be too big to dry run

5. Data Structure Brainstorm
    - Apply common data structures to the problem - Array, LL, BTree, Heap, etc.
