My solutions to some well-known programming problems
---

### How to solve problems?
1. Define
2. Representation
3. Approach/Strategy
4. Algorithm
5. Experiment

### Best Conceivable Runtime (BCR)
1. This is the lower bound of any algorithmic problem
2. For a problem, no algorithm can do better than BCR.

### Common optimizing techniques -
1. BUD
    - Remove Bottlenecks
    - Remove Unnecessary work
    - Remove Duplicated work

2. DIY
    - Use intuition and real-world examples to solve the problem intuitively.

3. Simplification & Generalization
    - Simplify the problem into a small problem

4. Base case & build
    - Start from a small example, say with n = 1 & then go all the way up until a pattern is observed
    - Example should not be a special case, be too small or be too big to dry run

5. Data Structure Brainstorm
    - Apply common data structures to the problem - Array, LL, BTree, Heap, etc.
